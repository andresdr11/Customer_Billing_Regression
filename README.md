# Valtel Telecommunications Billing Prediction
This repository contains a project that aims to predict the billing of various clients for a fictional company named Valtel Telecommunications. By leveraging historical billing data, this project seeks to forecast future client billing, which can aid in financial planning and client management strategies.

### Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to use statistical analysis and machine learning to predict the "TotalFacturado" (Total Billed) for clients based on historical data. The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, ensuring a structured approach to data mining.

### Methodology
* CRISP-DM Framework
The project adheres to the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, which encompasses the following phases:

* Business Understanding: Define the objectives and requirements from a business perspective.
* Data Understanding: Collect and explore the data to familiarize with the data structure and the underlying patterns.
* Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess data to facilitate effective modeling.
* Modeling: Develop and fine-tune predictive models.
* Evaluation: Assess the model using appropriate metrics.
* Deployment: Outline deployment strategies (not implemented in this project).

### Predictive Modeling
* Multiple Linear Regression: Implemented to predict the total amount billed to clients.
* Ridge Regression: Used to regularize the linear regression to prevent overfitting.
Results

The predictive model performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
* Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0065
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.0803
* Coefficient of Determination (R²): 0.9036
These metrics indicate a high level of accuracy in the model's predictions, with an R² value close to 1 showing that the model explains a significant portion of the variance in the billing data.

### Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical calculations.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing the regression models.
